# DistributedSystem-school-project

- The goal of the project was to create a distributed information system from 3 nodes. Each node is a physical computer in a web server and database server configuration
- Web app is capable of Basic CRUD operations.
- The files contain a database with ice players for testing the distributed system.
- In each configuration configuration node, it is necessary to insert the data of the respective node, including the IP address.
- For example, Hamachi VPN can be used to connect the nodes. Depending on your sysestem configuration, it might be necessery to disable Firevall protection to achieve functional distributed system.
- In the phpmyAdmin interface, it is necessary to create user accounts for each node and set their privileges. This step needs to be done on each node individually.
- This project was created in collaboration with another person
